This is my Senior Project for UNCC under the supervision of Professor Jing Yang.

This project is a search tool used for finding relevant articles. Using the Stanford
Topic Model program, I was able to get the distribution of terms in the articles
and group them by related topics. I uploaded the findings into an SQL database and
used a PHP script to retrieve the best related documents to a user search. The program
would display a list, in order of relevance, of articles and allow the user to open
the PDF files in the browser.

Unfortunately I only had one semester to work on this project and didn't finish the
project as we originally intended. The program was to be used with the the Microsoft 
Kinect and placed in the library on a TV screen for people to interact with. It would
have been a fun experiment to see how people would use touch-less technology in public
places.
