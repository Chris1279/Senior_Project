Visual Analysis and Semantic Exploration of Error Aware
Urban Change Detection
Paper 1104
Abstract
Many previous approaches to detecting urban change from LIDAR point clouds do not consider error and un-
certainty and simplify their calculations by interpolating into a regular grid structure, producing a 2D image as
output. We present a method of LIDAR change detection the accounts for error and uncertainty, maintains ac-
curacy, and extracts relevant changes as individual 3D models. We then utilize these models, alongside existing
GIS data, within an interactive application that allows the chronological exploration of the changes to an ur-
ban environment. A three-tiered level-of-detail system maintains a scale-appropriate, legible visual representation
across the entire range of view scales, from individual changes such as a buildings and trees, to groups of changes
such as new residential developments, deforestation, and construction sites, and finally to larger regions such as
neighborhoods and districts of a city that are emerging or undergoing revitalization. Tools are provided to assist
the visual analysis by urban planners and historians through semantic categorization and filtering of the changes
presented.

1. Introduction
In the mission statement for the USGS Center for LIDAR
Information Coordination and Knowledge (CLICK) it is ac-
knowledged that while "there has been increasing demand
for research utilizing all information generated from LIDAR
remote sensing data and not just [the resulting] bare earth
[Digital Elevation Maps (DEM)]," "research on using the
entire point cloud of this remote sensing data for scien-
tific applications has been slowed by a steep learning curve
on research and understanding involving utilizing the entire
point cloud." [USG07] Indeed, when examining previous ap-
proaches to the detection of urban change through LIDAR
data, we can see that most researchers choose to reduce the
complexity and detail of the point clouds into raster based
approximations for purposes of speed and ease of computa-
tion. It is evident that utilizing the unsimplified point cloud
has great advantages both in retaining maximum quality in
the resulting models and the ability to accurately determine
the uncertainty of the data, leading to knowledge of the con-
fidence one can have in those models and any calculations
performed on them.
The goal of a change detection algorithm should not be
to simply calculate the differences between two samplings,
but instead to determine, with a measure of confidence, if the
differences between the two are due to actual changes in the
physical environment or are the result of a combination of
various errors and uncertainties. As such, we start by requir-
ing data quality measures for our input data. These values
allow us to determine how much deviation between points
in the datasets could be due simply to collection errors and
therefore would not represent a change in the actual physical
world being sampled.
Our system presents these change models alongside ex-
isting Geographic Information System (GIS) data, within an
interactive application that allows the chronological explo-
ration of the changes to an urban environment. The system
has multiple coordinated views including a main 3D view,
a heat map view and a zoomed-in inspection view. For the
main 3D view a three-tiered level-of-detail system maintains
a scale-appropriate, legible visual representation across the
entire range of view scales, from individual changes such
as a buildings and trees, to groups and regions of changes.

Tools are provided to assist the visual analysis of changes
and their patterns through semantic categorization and fil-
tering of the extracted change models. Heat map signa-
tures capture the relationship between the footprint areas and
heights of change models. Semantic filters can be applied to
suppress or highlight typical classes of physical objects such
as trees, residential houses and road re-gradings.
2. Previous Approaches
A number of researchers have devised methods of detecting
changes in urban environments between LIDAR scans taken
at different times. Vu et al. [VMY04] focuses on updating
GIS records and assessing damage from earthquakes, Mu-
rakami et al [HMI99] sees application in the enforcement of
real estate taxes.
A common strategy these researchers take when attempt-
ing detection of changes between LIDAR scans is the trans-
formation of the LIDAR point clouds into a grid using
nearest-neighbor interpolation. As described in [VMY04]
this tactic is chosen because it is effective at decreasing the
amount of time needed to perform calculations. A grid reso-
lution is determined based on the density of the LIDAR sam-
ples from the pair of scans, and the values for each grid loca-
tion are generally determined by nearest-neighbor interpola-
tion to preserve the sharp height changes at building edges.
Murakami subtracts the grid values of one scan from
that of the other to produce a grid of values representing
height changes; image processing morphology operations
are used to filter out noise, and the cleaned-up difference
image is merged with an orthoimage for manual interpreta-
tion [HMI99]. In [VMY04] Vu et al determine the statistical
distribution of the intensity values of the difference image
and define those values beyond a certain number of stan-
dard deviations from the mean to be possible new construc-
tion, and likewise those below a certain number of standard
deviations from the mean to be possible demolition. Mor-
phological opening and reconstruction is again used to fil-
ter out undesirable results. Output from these approaches
are most commonly raster images or DEM files showing
those buildings determined to be newly constructed or de-
molished/damaged.
We argue that gridding the LIDAR data for ease and speed
of calculation not only introduces error to the data, but fails
to properly accommodate scans of different resolutions and
overlapping swaths, which can provide areas of higher res-
olution. The collection hardware used for each scan may
have significant differences in accuracy which should be pre-
served. A likely failing of these techniques is their indiffer-
ence towards the uncertainties of the sample collection meth-
ods themselves, although in fairness these are not likely to
effect the detection of changes as large as entire buildings.
To our knowledge there has been no interactive visual analy-
sis of raw LIDAR point cloud data similar to what we present
in this paper.
Finally, our analysis tools combines two 3D views with a
heat map. Heap maps have been used successfully in visual-
izations tools in multiple application domains [AvH04] and
are included with several commercial tools [Spo05]. In ge-
nomics, heat maps are used for the visualization of massive
gene arrays [JSS02] and provide a compact overview of the
data as well as a drill-down capability for detailed informa-
tion. Similar to our system, Chang et al [CWK?07] combine
an interactive heat map with a 3D visualization.
3. Implementation
The motivation for this work is to visualize the changes
due to construction and development between yearly LIDAR
scans of Mecklenburg County, North Carolina, which con-
tains the city of Charlotte and roughly 370,000 buildings.
The annual scans register quite well with each other. How-
ever, the density of the sample points leaves something to be
desired, with roughly 3-4 meters between points. The only
data used in this analysis is the raw LIDAR returns, in the
form of x,y,z points, which have not undergone filtering to
remove buildings or trees. This method is attractive because
it does not require the use or availability of supplementary
data such as classification or intensity values for the LIDAR
returns or aerial/satellite imagery.
3.1. Pre-Processing
Before processing, values for the horizontal and positional
accuracy of the LIDAR system used for collection must be
specified. These values allow us to account for the uncer-
tainty of sample points taken by different hardware systems,
as would likely be encountered when comparing datasets
collected across a span of years. By knowing the accu-
racy/error characteristics of each dataset, it can be deter-
mined how much deviation between points in the datasets
could be due simply to collection errors and therefore would
not represent a change in the actual physical world being
sampled.
Firstly, irregular triangular meshes are generated from the
LIDAR points using 2D Delaunay triangulation (we utilize
the CGAL library [Yvi07]). The resulting meshes serve two
purposes. During change detection points are projected into
the mesh of the opposing scan which allows us to quickly
determine surrounding points for comparison. The meshes,
as well as simplified (using [GH97]) versions of them, are
also stored for use as a reference surface models in the user
interface.
3.2. Error Aware Change Detection
The goal of the change detection process is to identify and
mark all the points in the new scan that are most likely to be
changes in the actual physical world and not merely changes
in measurement (collection error).

Paper 1104 / Visual Analysis of Urban Change 3
This is done by iteratively evaluating each point in the
new scan in the following manner: First the point in the new
scan is projected in 2D onto the triangulation of the old scan
to determine which face it falls within. The distance along
that face, from the projected point to the nearest vertex of
the face, minus any positional errors, is calculated. This dis-
tance is then used to determine a height allowance based on
the possible geologic variation that could be present between
the known sample points. The height of the point above the
interpolated face, minus any vertical measurement errors, is
then compared against the height allowance. If the point ex-
ceeds the bounds of what could be accounted for with known
errors and geologic variation, then it is considered to be a le-
gitimate change point and is marked as such.
See [BCWR07] for a more complete description of the
errors involved in generating terrain models from airborne
LIDAR points, and the techniques we have used here to ac-
count for these errors. Specifically, the technique used here
to classify single points is equivalent to the technique used
there to determine the occupancy of voxels, with the excep-
tion that we have incorporated additional positional and ele-
vation errors for the incoming point.
3.3. Filtering and Model Creation
The resulting set of marked points that have been classified
as significant changes will generally contain many "noisy"
objects caused by collection/data errors, low-resolution scan
returns sporadically striking tall thin objects such as broad-
cast antennas, street signs, telephone poles, etc.
Vu et al [VMY04], Murakami et al [HMI99], and others
have utilized morphological opening and reconstruction to
filter out small noisy changes from their results. This was
suitable for their purposes as their difference results were in
the form of a 2D grid with each pixel marked as being the
same or having changed. These image processing techniques
both reduce the accuracy of the changes reported and are not
applicable to our non-gridded point cloud results. We inte-
grate our noise filtering process within the process of creat-
ing models of the detected change points.
We begin by selecting a marked point and examining its
neighboring vertices in the triangulation to determine if any
have also been marked as changed. Here we can implement
the simplest form of noise reduction by disregarding any
marked vertices with no marked neighbors. If the point has
marked neighbors we can begin to build a model for this
change. We add the incident faces of the original point and
recursively visit the marked neighbors, adding their incident
faces to the current change model until we can no longer
reach any unvisited vertices. We can then store the extracted
model and proceed to select the next marked point that has
yet to be visited and continue this process until no unvisited
marked points remain.
The output of this process is a collection of 3D models
representing the changes between the two scans. We can now
perform yet another type of filtering by computing the sum
of the 2D area of the triangles in each model. To conserve
storage, change models below a specified area threshold can
be discarded at this step. This method is suited for dismiss-
ing small legitimate changes, such as trucks on a highway,
when the objective is to find more significant developments,
such as new construction. Change models also retain a count
of the marked change points they contained, allowing for fil-
tering by that criteria as well, which is advantageous in some
cases (such as removing small trees).
4. Presentation and Interaction
Our interactive application allows for a rich visual explo-
ration of the output data as opposed to more traditional out-
put formats (images or digital elevation maps) for this type
of result. We provide the basic behaviors and capabilities
of common existing GIS / 3D terrain applications (such as
Google Earth or ArcGIS) as well as visualizations that al-
low the user to analyze the results in a number of differ-
ent views. These include a main 3D view of the terrain with
highlighted changes, a sub-window showing a zoomed in,
inspection view of any user selected change objects, and a
semantic filtering sub-window utilizing a heat map. In the
heat map, the x and y axis correspond to the changed mod-
els footprint area and height, and the intensities of the cells
indicate the relative number of changed models matching
the cells area and height ranges. In addition to the semantic
filtering, through the use of manual area and change-point-
count thresholds, the user can permanently filter out spurious
changes they do not care about.
Existing available GIS data, such as streets, highways,
known building footprints, political boundaries, etc. provide
ease of navigation, meta-data for change models (such as es-
timated street address) and show the potential for integration
into a larger GIS environment. We draw the vector data di-
rectly onto the reference surface models and other 3D struc-
tures using the technique presented in [SK07].
Changes are presented to the user in the intuitive color
scheme of green representing new construction and growth,
and red representing demolitions, excavations, tree-clearing,
etc. The user can control the temporal aspect of the visual-
ization by switching between discrete years, where the ter-
rain reflects only that years scan with only the appropriate
new construction or demolition that has occurred displayed
overtop. A hybrid option is provided that presents data from
multiple years; new constructions are shown overtop of the
terrain from the previous scan in which they did not exist,
and demolitions are shown overtop terrain from the latter
scan in which the result can be seen. In this way, a change
is always presented against its counterpart for reference. See
Figure 4 for an example view of hybrid mode on an dense
urban area.
Due to the large amounts of data and the inherently

broad range of scales at which the dataset can be examined
(from individual houses at street level to county or statewide
views,) it is necessary to implement some form of level-of-
detail. It is here that we can exploit the level-of-detail con-
cept to not only control the amount of data we render, but to
change what it is we are rendering in order to appropriately
abstract the data into a form that makes sense, and is useful
to the user at that zoom-level.
4.1. Levels of Detail/Abstraction
When the user is zoomed in to a view that is significantly
close to the terrain, the system shows the unaltered change
models at full detail, as this allows for immediate inspec-
tion and interpretation of the change detection results. How-
ever, as the user zooms out, smaller change models quickly
become little more than a pixel or disappear altogether.
Figure 2: Changes to the university campus between 2002
and 2003. Green models represent new construction while
red models represent demolition or tree clearing. 2004 tax
database footprints are drawn in black. The selected build-
ing was currently under construction at the time, only filling
half the future 2004 footprint.
We counteract this problem with the introduction of a sec-
ond level-of detail/abstraction. As individual models recede
away from the camera, they gradually begin to glow and
are ultimately replaced by a semi-transparent splat which
is scaled to maintain near-constant screen-size regardless of
distance. These splats seamlessly fade in and take over while
the individual model detail level fades out.
The splats do not simply allow us to see individual
changes/buildings beyond the point at which their models
would disappear. They also provide an amalgamating be-
havior in which collections of individual changes cooperate
to form larger, more significant glyphs in the visualization.
This is shown in Figure 4 where in a series of increasingly
distant views, a new residential housing development seam-
lessly transforms from a few rows of individual buildings

set view is an area where the earth has been moved and re-

into a single blob representing the entire development as a
whole. This blob is visible long after the individual models
would have been too small to render as single pixels, aggre-
gating and preserving the development.
The third and final level of abstraction is displayed when
the user has zoomed out to a distance where depicting indi-
vidual changes and even amalgamated groups in splat form
no longer makes sense due to issues of overlap and extreme
clutter. At this level, the user is presented instead with urban
legibility regions. These regions are based on the level-of-
detail clusters generated by [CBZ?06] which delineate sec-
tions of the city based on aspects of urban legibility, such as
paths, districts, nodes, and other perceptual qualities. Origi-
nating from a LOD solution to city-viewing, these clusters
are naturally useful to display city-wide data in clustered
form at appropriate detail for a wide range of distances, as
demonstrated with census data in [CWK?07]. This ability is
clearly shown in Figure 7 where a significantly wide range of
zoom levels result in continuously legible images of the con-
centration of changes present. The shading of these regions
can be determined by several criteria, the simplest being the
comparative ratios of local to global change footprint areas,
number of change points, or number of individual changes.
4.2. Heat Map and Semantic Filtering
To allow a higher-level exploration of the results of the
change detection we provide a semantic filtering interface
utilizing a heat map. The heat map presents the distribu-
tion of the physical dimensions of the change models. The
X-axis corresponds to 2D projected area (footprint size),
while the Y-axis corresponds to the maximum height of the
change model above the surrounding terrain. The axes are
divided into bins, forming a matrix of cells. Change mod-
els are enumerated into these cells, and the intensity of each
cell indicates the relative number of change models meet-
ing that cells size ranges. A logarithmic scale is the default
mapping for intensity, as it allows better observation of the
less populous cells away from the main concentration areas,
however linear and exponential scales are also provided in
case changes follow uncommon distributions, or inspection
deeper into the main concentration is desired.
Different types of physical objects often have a particu-
lar signature in the heat map. For instance, individual trees
cut down will produce change models that are relatively tall
with very small footprint areas, while grading of dirt at a
construction site will tend to produce change models that
are relatively flat (low heights), but cover very large areas.
We can define these characteristics with sets of simple con-
ditionals and bounding functions (relating growth in height
to growth in area or vice versa) in order to delineate con-
tinuous regions in the heat map. These regions can then be
associated with a particular group of physical changes.
We provide predefined functions that create regions in the
heat map for trees, residential structures, commercial struc-
tures, and grading of earth. When the user selects one of
these filter categories, the associated cells in the heat map
are stippled with a unique color to indicate they are actively
filtering the changes presented in the other 3D views. See
Figure 5 for an illustration of the shapes these regions take
on in the heat map.
The user can also define their own custom filters by se-
lecting regions of cells in the heat map. This is advantageous
when looking for changes that are not as simply defined as
the provided categories, or to modify existing filters to better
suit a particular dataset. Filters are stackable to permit more
complex filtering.
An example of the usefulness of the custom semantic fil-
tering is shown in Figure 8. Here the user opts to view only
destruction changes, and creates a custom filter on the heat
map to show only changes above a certain area and within a
certain height range. The resulting 3D view allows the user
to easily extract the red change models showing both the de-
forestation (left and center) due to clear cutting for construc-
tion, and the volumes of rock removed at the granite quarry
(upper right).
Because the heat map provides a visual representation of
the statistical distribution of the changes, it can also be used
for a more general understanding of the types of changes
across the entire dataset or in a sub-region. As shown in Fig-
ure 6 we can compare the heat map for the edge region of
the city, which is under transformation from rural to subur-
ban, to the more established urban and suburban areas closer
to the city center. We see the wider distribution of changes,
especially in the height dimension, for the city center region.

Figure 5: Shown here are the regions selected in the heat
map generated by various semantic filters. The "trees" filter
produces the green region, "residential" - orange, "commer-
cial" - yellow, "grading" - brown, and and a user defined
region in black.
A possible explanation for this is that in the more established
regions, structures tend to be larger and taller, and vegetation
is more closely controlled.
5. Applications
Besides the stated application of analyzing the growth of a
urban region based on detected new construction, there are
other uses of this application that are being developed. The
most promising is the detection of unreported or inaccurately
reported construction. By comparing the changes extracted
from the LIDAR scans through our method with existing real
estate tax databases, we can look for buildings that do not
exist in tax records, or those that are inaccurately recorded.
Here, at the region level, instead of clustering changes to
show overall trends, we would instead seek to highlight out-
liers and mismatches. We are seeking to collaborate with
such enforcement agencies to evaluate the benefits of such
a system over current methods of real estate tax enforcement
and assessment, such as the use of aerial photography and in
situ inspections.
6. Limitations
We did not rely on (nor did we possess a complete set of)
any additional information besides the point locations of raw
LIDAR returns. However, additional sources of information
such as LIDAR return intensities or aerial imagery could
be used to help classify the detected changes based on the
reflectance characteristics of their surfaces (concrete, water,
vegetation, etc). When our system was presented to a group
of GIS users, this was one of the most requested modifica-
tions.
While realistic rendering of the terrain is not of concern
in this application, the method used for storage, retrieval,
and display of the reference surface models is still quite
primitive. This manifests itself in the seam artifacts present
(roughly every square mile) between each reference surface
model, a result of triangulations of points on each side of an
arbitrary division line, with no triangles formed across said
line. Clearly there is the need for the integration of a more
advanced terrain engine to elegantly manage the storage and
display of the reference models as a single entity. Hopefully
this issue will be addressed by integration of the successful
aspects of the visualization into an existing 3D terrain or GIS
package.
There is much potential for the addition of algorithms
such as automated target classification and pattern match-
ing to further the abilities of the semantic filtering functions.
This would be especially helpful in real GIS systems where
the end users may know exactly what changes they want to
ignore or expose, but are incapable of defining the specific
parameters themselves.
7. Conclusions
In line with the mission statement of the USGS Center for
LIDAR Information Coordination and Knowledge, we have
developed a system that compares LIDAR data from differ-
ent times and visualizes the differences in an intuitive and
legible manner. This system, combined with building foot-
prints from tax records and road information, provides a
powerful tool for visualizing and identifying constructions
and demolitions of buildings, grading of terrain, as well as
increases and decreases in forestation.
Instead of using traditional methods for creating regularly
gridded DEMs, our system maintains a high degree of accu-
racy by utilizing LIDAR point collections of any resolution
and consistency. More importantly, our emphasis on preserv-
ing the accuracy in the LIDAR data is carried throughout the
preprocessing and analysis processes in which any error in-
troduced by LIDAR scanning is taken into account.
The presentation of the resulting LIDAR data uses a three-
tiered LOD technique that is view dependent. This technique
ensures that constructions or demolitions of buildings are
clearly visible from all view distances and angles and allows
the user to see overviews as well as detailed information at
all times.
Lastly, by providing a heat map visualization of the distri-
bution of changes and enabling semantic filtering, we allow
the user to better explore the 3D results, and understand the
patterns contained within, in ways beyond the capabilities of
traditional 2D image results.
