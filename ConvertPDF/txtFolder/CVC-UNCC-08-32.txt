ABSTRACT 
Many organizations are adopting radio frequency identification technologies (RFID) as part of their 
information supply chains for the myriad of benefits that come through the use of such devices. But the 
applicability of RFID in other marketplaces is just beginning to be realized. One of these areas of 
significant potential is in medical information retrieval. The application of implantable RFID technology 
for medical information retrieval has been the subject of heated debate and controversy, regardless of the 
benefits that may be realized from such use. On one hand it has been called merely an extension of the 
technologies we already embrace (such as cell phones, Bluetooth devices, MP3 players, etc.), while on the 
other it has even been referred to as the “Mark of the Beast” by certain evangelical movements [1]. In this 
study, we outline some of the advantages and disadvantages of implantable RFID devices, then follow up 
with an in-depth survey and analysis of consumer perceptions. 
Keywords:  Technology Acceptance, Medical RFID, Implantable RFID.

INTRODUCTION 
The pending wide-scale adoption of radio frequency identification (RFID) technologies has been the 
subject of significant debate in professional and academic circles for some time. Mandates by Wal-Mart, 
Target Corp. and Albertson’s in the United States, Metro Group in Germany, and Carrefour in France 
have pushed the use of RFID in retailing while governmental regulations on the traceability of food in the 
United States and Europe have pushed RFID into food production [4]. RFID is also being used in security 
systems, healthcare, livestock tracking, parcel and parts tracking, casinos, U.S. toll roads, law 
enforcement, and the U.S. Department of Defense [2]. As the potential markets for RFID continue to 
expand, the inherent concerns regarding privacy risk associated with the technology become increasingly 
important.  
RFID chips or tags are increasingly used in the healthcare industry specifically in addressing the 
emerging threats of diversion, theft and counterfeit medications. In addition to healthcare supply chain 
management, hospitals use RFID to prevent infants from being switched in nurseries and to track in-
patient Alzheimer’s sufferers. But while government agencies consider the use of RFID in healthcare and 
debate controls and regulations for the technology, privacy and consumer advocates continue to worry 
about the possible abuses of RFID [1][8]. 
In 2004, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave approval to VeriChip, a Florida-based company 
that has been developing implantable RFID chips for the past 15 years, (primarily to tag livestock and 
pets), to implant RFID chips in human beings for the purpose of medical information retrieval [3]. With 
the VeriChip system, the patient’s information is not embedded upon the chip, but rather is housed within 
VeriChip’s online, secure database. When hospital personnel pass a scanner over the implanted RFID 
chip, the chip’s identifier is displayed on the screen of an RFID reader [5]. An authorized health 
professional can then use the identifier to access the patient’s clinical information from the VeriChip 
database. Between 2004 and 2006, VeriChip claims to have implanted RFID devices in more than 2,000 
people around the world, 60 of those in the United States [3]. 
Systems such as the VeriChip system may offer certain medical benefits, such as expedited patient 
identification, expedited medical records retrieval, and expedited treatment and/or problem diagnosis [5].  
But such systems also raise ethical concerns regarding patient privacy.  
The principal argument against RFID technology has always been and continues to be the privacy risk the 
technology poses to consumers. Retail items tagged with RFID chips can be scanned by anyone with an 
appropriate RFID scanner. According to Spiekermann and Ziekow (2005) there are five immediate and 
key threats posed by RFID technology, all related to the issue of privacy: 
1. Unauthorized assessment of one’s belongings by others 
2. Tracking of persons via their objects 
3. Retrieving social networks 
4. Technology paternalism 
5. Making people responsible for their objects 
These concerns speak specifically to RFID tags found within consumer goods, but when the RFID device 
is within the human body, and contains a link to personal information, the issue of privacy becomes of far 
greater concern. Critics of the technology are particularly concerned with the risk of a patient’s 
identifying information being used for nonmedical purposes, stating that “unauthorized access could 
potentially result in social discrimination, the loss of health care coverage, or the publication of 
potentially sensitive medical information” [5, p. 1709]. 
 3
Problems with Current Implantation Standards: VeriChip 
The current standard permitted by the FDA requires that no personal information be stored on an 
individual RFID device, but that the device contains only a unique identifier to serve as a link to a 
patient’s medical information, housed within a separate and secure database [5]. This regulation greatly 
diminishes the risk of abuse of personal information related to implanted RFID devices, but does not 
guarantee the security or accuracy of the database containing the information. In fact, when an individual 
consents to implantation with a VeriChip RFID tag, he or she must sign an informed consent agreement 
that absolves VeriChip of any and all liability with respect to the security of its own database, as well as 
the accuracy of the information contained therein [8]. Even the FDA acknowledges that the VeriChip 
system may cause a range of technical failures and compromised information security [8].  
While the VeriChip design diminishes privacy and security risk, it is not an error proof solution. VeriChip 
states that it does not guarantee the accuracy of the medical information stored within their secure online 
database [8]. It also absolves itself of any personal damage a client may incur due to a security breach, 
which may result in crimes such as medical ID theft [8].  
In addition, hospitals are required to have special access to the VeriChip database to retrieve an 
individual’s medical information. VeriChip’s design is also proprietary, meaning that hospitals must be 
set up to accommodate VeriChip’s design and data format. The very nature of the design demands that it 
be proprietary and difficult to access, otherwise the risk of unauthorized access into the system greatly 
increases. However, it is unlikely that all hospitals will make use of the same system, that they would 
agree on a standardized system of medical identification such as VeriChip, particularly as competing 
products are introduced to the market.  
Another concern is that RFID does not fall under the protection of the Health Insurance Portability and 
Accountability Act (HIPAA), because it has no medical significance. Therefore there are no laws to 
regulate how or by whom RFID tags may be scanned, or the unique identifiers recorded. Consequently, 
the potential for privacy invasion and information abuse as the result of inter-database linkage is vast [5]. 
Alternative Design 
The functionality of RFID devices is limited, and FDA regulations currently prevent increased 
functionality. But as the capabilities of RFID devices expand, and especially if active RFID devices 
(those with their own power source, capable of broadcasting their own signal) are approved by the FDA, 
the risk of information abuse becomes even greater, as such devices could disclose the location of the 
owner and/or carry significant personal information [5].  
We propose that as the capabilities of RFID devices expand, particularly in regards to the amount of data 
the devices themselves may contain, it may be useful for consumers as well as government agencies to 
consider alternative means by which the technology may be used for medical information retrieval. 
Specifically, we are interested in evaluating consumer responses to both the VeriChip type of system, as 
well as another design, which would embed critical health-related information on an implanted RFID tag, 
but without any specific identifying information. This design would function much as the medical alert 
bracelets, listing significant allergies, health conditions, even organ donor information or resuscitation 
preferences. Such a tag could be scanned by emergency medical or hospital personnel, providing 
caregivers with immediate access to critical health-related information, while leaving the patient’s 
identification to more traditional means. This design is also more accurate than the VeriChip design. 
Personal medical information is more likely to be correct and accurate if it is controlled by the individual, 
the owner of the information, rather than by a third party. 
 4
We are on the verge of massive technological advances in health care information, characterized by 
Google’s launching of their web health services this week as well as other companies and technologies 
going in this direction [6]. It is imperative that we think now about the type of system we want for the 
future. If we can determine the types of systems consumers are more likely to accept, we can greatly 
increase the chances of system acceptance and thereby achieve greater efficiencies within the health care 
system. Health care reform continues to be a major political issue, and if reforms are forthcoming, it is 
important that we understand what is likely to be most acceptable to consumers. 
METHODOLOGY 
The research methodology was conducted using a series of semi-structured interviews conducted with 
both potential users of the technology as well as healthcare professionals, including paramedics, nurses, 
doctors and administrators. Through these interviews, we assessed the perceptions and usage intentions of 
potential users of the technologies, those who may suffer from the health issues these technologies 
address, as well as the perceptions of healthcare professionals, toward three different potential uses of 
implantable RFID devices for medical information retrieval. 
1) The VeriChip design, which employs an implanted RFID tag containing a unique identifier that 
can be used to access a patient’s personal medical information within a separate secure database; 
2) An alternative design (CrypChip), which stores critical health-related information ? such as 
serious allergies, permanent health conditions, etc., but no personal identifying information ? 
directly on the RFID tag; 
3) A design identical to the alternative design presented above (CrypChipPlus), but with the addition 
of a unique identifier (such as that employed in the VeriChip design) that can be used to link to 
the patient’s medical record and identifying information in an online, secure database. 
Interview subjects were asked to read or listen to a brief education piece outlining the basics of RFID 
implant technology, its benefits and liabilities, as well as a brief description of each of the three proposed 
design alternatives prior to offering their responses to the interview questions. They were not given 
additional information or encouragement, and any questions they had were left unanswered to avoid the 
injection of author bias. Their responses were therefore based solely on their immediate understanding of 
the brief presentation they received. A copy of the interview we used may be found in Appendix A. 
DISCUSSION 
We interviewed 13 subjects individually, five from healthcare professions and eight potential users of 
implantable RFID devices, to ascertain overall perceptions and preferences regarding the three alternative 
designs presented. Of the healthcare professionals we interviewed, three were male and two were female. 
Of the potential users, four males and four females were interviewed. One subject in each of the two 
groups refused to answer the questions completely on the grounds that they considered RFID technology 
to be the “Mark of the Beast,” a number or identifier issued to the followers of Satan according to certain 
interpretations of Revelation 13:7 and 14:9-11 in the Christian New Testament.  
Our healthcare professionals deemed the VeriChip design to be the least desirable and least useful of the 
three designs presented. It was preferred by none of the subjects and was split evenly with the 
CrypChipPlus design as the least secure and least trustworthy. Despite sharing the honor of least secure 
and least trustworthy with VeriChip, the CrypChipPlus design shared even preference with CrypChip as 
 5
well as greatest convenience benefit. The CrypChip design was unanimously preferred by those who 
submitted answers as the most secure design. 
Regarding actual usage of the described products, four out of five of our healthcare professionals were 
either “not at all” likely or only “somewhat likely” to use the VeriChip design. Four out of five were also 
either “not at all” likely or only “somewhat likely” to use the CrypChip design. Three of the five subjects 
said they were “somewhat likely” or “not at all” likely to use the CrypChipPlus design. Only 26.7% of 
our healthcare professionals said they were “likely,” “very likely” or “certain” to use any of the three 
described products. This is a clear indication of the reluctance of our healthcare professionals to accept 
implanted RFID technology. Complete results of these interviews are shown in Table 1 below.

Like our healthcare professionals, our potential users also deemed the VeriChip design to be the least 
desirable and least useful of the three designs presented. It was preferred by only one of the subjects and 
was split evenly with the CrypChipPlus design as the least secure and least trustworthy. Despite sharing 
the honor of least secure and least trustworthy with VeriChip, our potential users felt the CrypChipPlus 
design offered the greatest convenience benefit. Meanwhile, the CrypChip design was preferred by five of 
the seven who submitted answers as the most secure and most trustworthy design. Interestingly, the other 
two subjects each chose VeriChip as the most secure. Of those two, one cited her reason for selecting 
VeriChip as her inability to understand the concept of data encryption, while the other indicated he chose 
 6
VeriChip because he did not understand the applicability and usefulness of a retinal scan in the other 
designs. 
Despite their opinions regarding the usefulness of the products, however, our potential users were even 
less likely to use them than our healthcare professionals. Seven of eight responses issued per product were 
“not at all” likely or only “somewhat likely” to use. Only 12.5% of the responses issued were “likely,” 
“very likely” or “certain.” To an even greater degree than our healthcare professionals, this demonstrates 
a significant reluctance to accept implanted RFID technology. Complete results of these interviews are 
shown in Table 2 below.

The additional comments provided by both our healthcare professionals and our potential users offered 
significant insight into common concerns, other possible uses, future potential as well as possible design 
limitations. For example, one of our subjects expressed a concern regarding the changeable nature of a 
person’s health. Hardcoding certain elements on the chip would therefore be counter-productive. We 
would not be able to record information regarding medications, temporary conditions, or other similar 
health-related issues on the implanted device. Doing so would require a replacement device each time a 
 7
health condition or medication changed. Encoded data must therefore be limited to critical and permanent 
information such as blood type, drug allergies and other permanent health conditions given the limitations 
of the present technology.  
Privacy and security were the greatest overall concerns, particularly regarding an open source 
implementation. Some subjects saw so much potential for the technology in so many areas that their chief 
concern was the potential trafficking of too much personal information and the enormous challenges that 
exist in securing that much data. 
One interesting concern was expressed by the EMTs we interviewed. Concerned about the amount of 
equipment they already carry, they felt the addition of RFID scanners would be an unnecessary 
encumbrance. In addition, we learned that EMTs have, through the course of their training and 
experience, come to rely heavily upon their ability to make quick and accurate visual diagnoses in 
emergency situations. They are concerned that if they were required to rely upon technology scans before 
administering treatment, their effectiveness, and thus the health of their patients, would be compromised. 
Sometimes the greatest asset is human judgement. It may be that this technology would be less applicable 
to EMTs and First Responders. Further research is required before any such judgement can be passed. 
CONCLUSION 
While we did not formulate specific hypotheses for this study, we expected to see certain results, and 
those results were indeed verified through this first series of interviews. First, we expected to see that 
people are generally reluctant to accept implanted technologies. This expectation was realized. The idea 
of deliberately injecting a technological device into one’s body is not necessarily appealing, and is 
considered by most people to be invasive. A significant convenience benefit must be demonstrated before 
such reluctance can begin to be alleviated. 
Second, we expected our subjects’ most prevalent concerns to be the privacy and security of their 
personal and private information. This expectation was realized. A significant convenience benefit, 
coupled with high-confidence security measures must be demonstrated before such reluctance can begin 
to be alleviated. However, our subjects’ resistance to both the VeriChip and CrypChipPlus designs, 
designs that incorporate online databases, demonstrates additional concerns regarding both the security 
and the accuracy of the data. Where a third party is involved in maintaining medical records, data 
accuracy becomes a key issue. Further research is required to develop sound data integrity control 
mechanisms before consumer confidence can begin to improve in this area. 
Third, we expected to see concerns regarding the implementation of open source software for the purpose 
of decrypting the data stored on the RFID device, as well as for the proposed medical records database 
suggested with the CrypChipPlus design. This expectation was also realized. Significant security 
measures must be researched and developed to ensure the protection and integrity of the recorded 
personal information in an open source environment.  
Finally, we expected to encounter a level of resistance from those who oppose RFID technology in all its 
forms for religious reasons. This expectation was also realized. Two of our thirteen respondents, one from 
each of the two categories, both female, refused to answer the questions completely on the basis that they 
believed RFID to be the “Mark of the Beast” as spoken of in the book of Revelation in the Christian 
Bible. While many consider the association of the “Mark of the Beast” with RFID technology to test 
credulity at best, it is a public perception that cannot be ignored. Books such as Steps Toward the Mark of 
the Beast by Glenn A. Guest and, most notably, Spychips: How Major Corporations and Government 
Plan to Track Your Every Move with RFID by Katherine Albrecht and Liz McIntyre have been rather 
 8
successful at vilifying RFID technology through misrepresentation and gross inaccuracies regarding the 
capabilities and potential uses of the technology. This perception of RFID may not be a predominant 
perception, but it is popular enough to render significant resistance to the adoption or acceptance of the 
technology, particularly regarding implantable RFID devices, regardless of any verifiable benefit. This 
may be one of the most difficult challenges RFID technology faces. Religious zeal if a powerful force that 
is not easily dissuaded. Despite attempts by many theologians and clergymen to discredit the misguided 
notions presented by authors such as Albrecht, McIntyre and Guest through counter publications and 
sermons, religious opposition to RFID continues to grow. Further research is necessary to determine 
whether education can alleviate concerns of this nature. A study involving active as opposed to passive 
RFID tags, perhaps where the active tags can only be “turned on” or activated by authorized healthcare 
personnel, may see a reduction in the “Mark of the Beast” comparisons.  
Despite their personal resistance to the technology, most of our respondents believe in a significant future 
for RFID devices, implanted and otherwise. Subjects suggested it be used for Department of Justice 
applications, specifically for the tagging and tracking of convicts and parolees, especially sexual 
predators. Other suggested uses were for drug enforcement applications and traffic control, especially 
unmanned speed monitoring. We are only beginning to realize the potential of this technology, but it will 
require significant future research to determine whether consumers are willing to accept that potential.

APPENDIX A – Interview: Implanted RFID Devices for Medical Information Retrieval 
RFID Medical Implants - Introduction 
In 2004, the FDA approved the use of implanted RFID technology in humans. RFID implants are very 
small Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) devices, about the size of a grain of rice, that can be 
implanted virtually anywhere on the body, but are often inserted into the soft tissue between the thumb 
and forefinger. These devices hold a very small amount of data, typically just a 15-digit alpha-numeric 
code that is used to uniquely identify the device and the person or object associated with it. RFID 
implants have been used for a variety of purposes, from VIP treatment in European nightclubs to linking 
implantees to their medical records in an online database.  
Medical information retrieval is a usage area for this technology that shows significant promise, but that 
has also received equally significant criticism. Critics of the technology are particularly concerned with 
the risk of a patient’s identifying information being used for nonmedical purposes, stating that 
“unauthorized access could potentially result in social discrimination, the loss of health care coverage, or 
the publication of potentially sensitive medical information.” There are certain benefits, however, such as 
rapid condition identification and treatment, particularly regarding emergency care, that such devices 
offer to both healthcare providers and patients. This survey explores three alternative designs for such 
devices and seeks patient and healthcare provider feedback regarding these designs. 
Possible Implant Alternatives 
1. VeriChip ? the patient’s information is not embedded upon the chip, but rather is housed within 
VeriChip’s online, secure database. When hospital personnel pass a scanner over the implanted 
RFID chip, the chip’s identifier is displayed on the screen of an RFID reader. An authorized 
health professional can then use the identifier to access the patient’s clinical information from the 
VeriChip database.  
Pros Cons 
Personal medical and identifying information is stored in a 
secure, online, third-party database. 
Requires users to sign informed consent absolving 
VeriChip of liability pertaining to the security as well as 
accuracy of personal data. 
Only VeriChip authorized hospitals, clinics, and medical 
personnel can access medical records. 
Proprietary –  requires hospitals to set up VeriChip 
accounts and to have special access to VeriChip 
databases to retrieve medical information.  
Relatively inexpensive for consumers –  about $400 per 
chip + $10 - $80 annual fee for information storage 
(depending on plan) –  and for most hospitals, scanners 
are about $600. 
Widespread effectiveness requires all hospitals and care 
centers to use the same system. 
Users can choose among different storage plans –  from 
minimal information such as contact and doctor info to 
complete medical histories and records. 
May be cost-prohibitive to smaller or rural hospitals and 
clinics, as well as low-income patients.  
 
2. CrypChip ? stores critical health-related information ? such as serious allergies, health 
conditions, etc., but no personal identifying information ? directly on the RFID tag; this data is 
encrypted to protect the privacy of the individual, using an encryption key that is based upon a 
unique biometric feature, such as a retinal scan. 
 10
Pros Cons 
No identifying information No identifying information –  identification must be done 
through more traditional means 
Open source, free software, no contracts or proprietary 
software required –  available and usable by virtually all 
clinics, hospitals, emergency personnel. 
 
Encrypted data, with encryption key tied to unique 
biometric feature (retinal scan) 
Retinal scan can be prone to false rejection, other 
biometric features have potential drawbacks 
 
3. CrypChipPlus ? identical to CrypChip, but with the addition of a unique identifier (such as that 
employed in the VeriChip design) that can be used to link to the patient’s complete medical 
record and identifying information in an online, secure database. 
Pros Cons 
No identifying information on chip Database must be managed by third party at additional 
cost. 
Chip includes link to medical record in online, secure open-
source database 
Accuracy and security of database records cannot be 
guaranteed. 
Open source, free software, no contracts or proprietary 
software required, inexpensive hardware –  scanner 
 
Encrypted data, with encryption key tied to unique biometric 
feature (retinal scan) 
Retinal scan can be prone to false rejection, other 
biometric features have potential drawbacks
