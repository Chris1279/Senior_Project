Abstract: Previous studies on social networks are often focused on networks 
with only positive relations between individual nodes. As a significant 
extension, we conduct the spectral analysis on graphs with both positive and 
negative edges. Specifically, we investigate the impacts of introducing negative 
edges and examine patterns in the spectral space of the graph’s adjacency 
matrix. Our theoretical results show that communities in a k-balanced signed 
graph are distinguishable in the spectral space of its signed adjacency matrix 
even if connections between communities are dense. This is quite different 
from recent findings on unsigned graphs, where communities tend to mix 
together in the spectral space when connections between communities become 
dense. We further conduct theoretical studies based on graph perturbation to 
examine spectral patterns of general unbalanced signed graphs. We illustrate 
our theoretical findings with various empirical evaluations on both synthetic 
data and real world Correlates of War data.

1 Introduction 
Most social network analysis approaches focused on unsigned graphs, where an edge 
between two nodes represents a presence of a relationship (e.g., trust or friendship) 
between two individuals. However, relationships could be inherently negative to express 
distrust or dislike. In contrast to the extensive studies on social networks that restrict to 
only positive relationships between individuals, in this paper we study signed networks 
with both positive and negative relationships. 
Signed networks were originally used in anthropology and sociology to model 
friendship and enmity (Davis, 1967; Hage and Harary, 1983). The motivation for signed 
networks arose from the fact that psychologists use –1, 0, and 1 to represent disliking, 
indifference, and liking, respectively. Graph topology of signed networks can then be 
expressed as an adjacency matrix where an entry is 1 (or –1) if the relationship is positive 
(or negative) and 0 if the relationship is absent. 
Spectral analysis techniques for 0–1 matrices corresponding to a given network have 
been well developed. As a significant extension, in this paper we investigate the influence 
of introducing negative edges in the graph topology and examine community patterns in 
the spectral space of its signed adjacency matrix. We start from k-balanced signed graphs

which have been extensively examined in social psychology, especially from the stability 
of sentiments perspective (Inohara, 2002). Our theoretical results show that communities 
in a k-balanced signed graph are distinguishable in the spectral space of its signed 
adjacency matrix even when connections between communities are dense. This is very 
different from recent findings on unsigned graphs (e.g., Ying and Wu, 2009; Prakash  
et al., 2010), where communities tend to mix together when connections between 
communities become dense. We provide a theoretical explanation through treating the  
k-balanced signed graph as a perturbed variant of a disconnected k-block network. We 
further conduct theoretical studies based on graph perturbation to examine spectral 
patterns of general unbalanced signed graphs. We illustrate our theoretical findings with 
various empirical evaluations. 
2 Notation 
A signed graph G can be represented as a symmetric adjacency matrix An×n with aij = 1 if 
there is a positive edge between the nodes i and j, aij = –1 if there is a negative edge 
between the nodes i and j, and aij = 0 otherwise. A has n real eigenvalues. Let ?i be the ith 
largest eigenvalue of A with the eigenvector xi, ?1 ? ?2 ?···? ?n. Let xij denote the jth entry 
of xi. The spectral decomposition of A is .Ti i iiA x x=? ?

Formula (1) illustrates our notions. The eigenvector xi is represented as a column  
vector. There usually exist k leading eigenvalues that are significantly greater than the 
remaining ones for networks with k well-separated communities. We call the row vector 
?u = (x1u, x2u,···,xku) the spectral coordinate of node u in the k-dimensional subspace 
spanned by (x1,···,xk). This subspace contains most topological information of the original 
graph. We denote the ith canonical basis as ?i = (0,…,0, 1, 0,…,0), where the ith entry of ?i 
is 1 and all other entries are zero. 
Let E be a symmetric perturbation matrix, and B be the adjacency matrix after 
perturbation, i.e., B = A + E. Similarly, let ?i be the ith largest eigenvalue of B with 
eigenvector yi, and yij is the jth entry of yi. Row vector 1( , , )u u kuy y? = "  is the spectral 
coordinate of node u after perturbation. 
3 The spectral property of k-balanced graph 
The k-balanced graph is one type of signed graphs that have received extensive 
examinations in social psychology. It was shown that the stability of sentiments is 
   
 
   
   
 
   
   
 
   
   4 L. Wu et al.    
 
    
 
 
   
   
 
   
   
 
   
       
 
equivalent to k-balanced (clusterable). A necessary and sufficient condition for a signed 
graph to be k-balanced is that the signed graph does not contain a cycle with exactly one 
negative edge (Davis, 1967). 
Definition 1: Graph G is a k-balanced graph if the node set V can be divided into k  
non-trivial disjoint subsets such that V1,…,Vk, edges connecting any two nodes from the 
same subset are all positive, and edges connecting any two nodes from different subsets 
are all negative. 
The k node sets, V1,…,Vk, naturally form k communities denoted by C1,…,Ck 
respectively. Let ( )| | ,i i iin V n n= =?  and Ai be the ni × ni adjacency matrix of 
community Ci. After ordering the nodes properly, the adjacency matrix B of a k-balanced 
graph can be written as: 
1 0
,  where ,

and E represents the negative edges across communities. More generally, euv = 1(–1) if a 
positive(negative) edge is added between the nodes u and v, and euv = 0 otherwise. 
3.1 Non-negative block-wise diagonal matrix 
For a graph with k disconnected communities, its adjacency matrix A is shown in (2). Let 
?i be the largest eigenvalue of Ai with eigenvector zi of dimension ni. Without loss of 
generality, we assume ?1 >···> ?k. Since the entries of Ai are all non-negative, with  
Perron-Frobenius theorem (Stewart and Sun, 1990), ?i is positive and all the entries of its 
eigenvector zi are non-negative. When the k communities are comparable in size, ?i is the 
ith largest eigenvalues of A (i.e., ?i = ?i), and the eigenvectors of Ai can be naturally 
expanded to the eigenvalues of A as follows:

Now, consider the node u in community Ci. Note that all the entries in xi are  
non-negative, and the spectral coordinate of node u is just the uth row of the matrix in (3). 
Then, we have 
( )0, ,0, , 0, ,0 ,u iux? = " "  (4) 
where xiu > 0 is the only non-zero entry of ?u. In other words, for a graph with k 
disconnected comparable communities, spectral coordinates of all nodes locate on k 
positive half-axes of canonical basis ?1,···,?k and nodes from the same community locate 
on the same half axis.

3.3 Moderate inter-community edges 
Proposition 1: Let B = A + E where A has k disconnected communities and || E ||2  ?k 
and E is non-positive. We have the following properties: 
1 If node u ? Ci is not connected to any Cj (j ? i), u?  lies on the half-line ri that starts 
from the origin, where ri is the ith row of matrix R shown in (6). The k half-lines are 
approximately orthogonal to each other. 
2 If node u ? Ci is connected to node v ? Cj (j ? i), u?  deviate from ri. Moreover, the 
angle between u?  and rj is an obtuse angle. 
To illustrate Proposition 1, we now consider a two-balanced graph. Suppose that a graph 
has two communities and we add some sparse edges between two communities. For node 
u ? C1 and v ? C2, with (5), the spectral coordinates can be approximated as

The item 1 of Proposition 1 is apparent from (7) and (8). For those nodes with no  
inter-community edges, the second parts of the right-hand side (RHS) of (7) and (8) are 0 
since all euv’s are 0, and hence they lie on the two half-lines r1 (nodes in C1) and r2 (nodes 
in C2). Note that r1 and r2 are orthogonal since 1 2 0.

If node u ? C1 has some negative links to C2 (euv = –1), 2,u r?? ?  is thus negative. In other 
words, u?  lies outside the two half-lines r1 and r2. 
Another interesting pattern is the direction of rotation of the two half lines. For the 
two-balanced graph, r1 and r2 rotate counter-clockwise from the axis ?1 and ?2. Notice 
that all the added edges are negative (euv = –1), and hence

counter-clockwise rotation from the basis. 
• Comparison with adding positives edges: when the added edges are all positive  
(euv = 1), we can derive the following two properties in a similar manner: 
1 nodes with no inter-community edges lie on the k half-lines (when k = 2, the two 
half-lines exhibit a clockwise rotation from the axes) 
2 for node u ? Ci that connects to node v ? Cj, u?  and rj form an acute angle. 
Figure 1 shows the scatter plot of the spectral coordinates for a synthetic graph, Synth-2. 
Synth-2 is a two-balanced graph with 600 and 400 nodes in each community. We 
generate Synth-2 and modify its inter-community edges via the same method as synthetic 
dataset Synth-3 in Section 5.1. As we can see in Figure 1(a), when the two communities 
are disconnected, the nodes from C1 and C2 lie on the positive part of axis ?1 and ?2 
respectively. We then add a small number of edges connecting the two communities  
(p = 0.05). When the added edges are all negative, as shown in Figure 1(b), the spectral 
coordinates of the nodes from the two communities form two half-lines respectively. The 
two quasi-orthogonal half-lines rotate counter-clockwise from the axes. Nodes with 
negative inter-community edges lie outside the two half-lines. On the contrary, if we  
add positive inter-community edges, as shown in Figure 1(c), the nodes from two 
communities display two half-lines with a clockwise rotation from the axes, and nodes 
with inter-community edges lie between the two half-lines.

Theorem 1 holds when the magnitude of perturbation is moderate. With perturbation of 
large magnitude, we can divide the perturbation matrix into several perturbation matrices 
of small magnitude and approximate the eigenvectors step by step. More general, the

One property implied by (9) is that, after adding negative inter-community edges, nodes 
from different communities are still separable in the spectral space. Note that R is close to 
an orthogonal matrix, and hence the first part of RHS of (9) specifies an orthogonal 
transformation. The second part of RHS of (9) specifies a deviation away from the 
position after the transformation. Note that when the inter-community edges are all 
negative (euv = –1), the deviation of ?u is just towards the negative direction of ?v (each 
dimension is weighted with 1).i
??  Therefore, after perturbation, the nodes u and v are 
further separable from each other in the spectral space. The consequence of this 
repellency caused by adding negative edges is that nodes from different communities stay 
away from each other in the spectral space. As the magnitude of the noise increases, more 
nodes deviate from the half-lines ri, and the line pattern eventually disappears. 
• Positive large perturbation: When the added edges are positive, we can similarly 
observe the opposite phenomenon: more nodes from the two communities are 
‘pulled’ closer to each other by the positive inter-community edges and are finally 
mixed together, indicating that the well-separable communities merge into one 
community. 
Figure 2 shows the spectral coordinate of Synth-2 when we increase the number of  
inter-community edges (p = 0.1, 0.3 and 1). For Figures 2(a) to 2(c), we add negative 
inter-community edges in Synth-2, and for Figures 2(d) to 2(f), we add positive  
inter-community edges. As we add more and more inter-community edges, no matter 
positive or negative, more and more nodes deviate from the two half-lines, and finally the 
line pattern diminishes in Figures 2(c) or 2(f). When adding positive inter-community 
edges, the nodes deviate from the lines and hence finally mix together as show in  
Figure 2(f), indicating that two communities merge into one community. Different from 
adding positive edges, which mixes the two communities in the spectral space, adding 
negative inter-community edges ‘pushes’ the two communities away from each other. 
This is because nodes with negative inter-community edges lie outside the two half-lines 
as shown in Figures 2(a) and 2(b). Even when p = 1, as shown in Figure 2(c), two 
communities are still clearly separable in the spectral space. 
4 Unbalanced signed graph 
Signed networks in general are unbalanced and their topologies can be considered as 
perturbations on balanced graphs with some negative connections within communities 
and some positive connections across communities. Therefore, we can divide an 
unbalanced signed graph into three parts 
in out ,B A E E= + +  (10) 
where A is a non-negative block-wise diagonal matrix as shown in (2), Ein represents the 
negative edges within communities, and Eout represents the both negative and positive 
inter-community edges. 
 
 
   
 
   
   
 
   
   
 
   
   10 L. Wu et al.    
 
    
 
 
   
   
 
   
   
 
   
       
 
• Add negative inner-community edges: for the block-wise diagonal matrix A, we  
first discuss the case where a small number of negative edges are added within the 
communities. Ein is also a block-wise diagonal. Hence, in 0
T
ij i jx E x? = =  for all  
i ? j, and matrix R caused by Ein in (6) is reduced to the identity matrix I. 
Consider that we add one negative inner-community edge between the nodes  
u, v ? Ci. Since R = I, only ?i and xi are involved in approximating and :u v? ? 

Without loss of generality, assume xiu > xiv, and we have the following properties 
when adding euv = –1: 
1 both the nodes u and v move towards the negative part of axis ?i after 
perturbation: yiu < xiu and yiv < xiu. 
2 node v moves farther than u after perturbation: | yiv – xiv | > | yiu – xiu |. 
The two preceding properties imply that, for those nodes close to the origin, adding 
negative edges would ‘push’ them towards the negative part of axis ?i, and a small 
number of nodes can thus lie on the negative part of axis ?i, i.e., yiu < 0. 
• Add inter-community edges: the spectral perturbation caused by adding Eout to  
matrix A + Ein can be complicated. Notice that (A + Ein) is still a block-wise matrix, 
and we can still apply Theorem 1 and conclude that, when Eout is moderate, the  
major nodes from k communities form k lines in the spectral space and nodes with 
inter-community edges deviate from the lines. 
It is difficult to give the explicit form of the lines and the deviations, because xiu and 
the inter-community edges can be either positive or negative. However, we expect 
that the effect of adding negative edges on positive nodes is still dominant in 
determining the spectral pattern, because most nodes lie along the positive part of the 
axes and the majority of inter-community edges are negative. Communities are still 
distinguishable in the spectral space. The majority of nodes in one community lie on 
the positive part of the line, while a small number of nodes may lie on the negative 
part due to negative connections within the community. 
We make graph Synth-2 unbalanced by flipping the signs of a small proportion q of the 
edges. When the two communities are disconnected, as shown in Figure 3(a), after 
flipping q = 0.1 inner-community edges, a small number of nodes lie on the negative 
parts of the two axes. Figure 3(b) shows the spectral coordinates of the unbalanced graph 
generated from balanced graph Synth-2 (p = 0.1, q = 0.1). Since the size of the  
inter-community edges is small, we can still observe two orthogonal lines in the scatter 
plots. The negative edges within the communities cause a small number of nodes lie on 
the negative parts of the two lines. Nodes with inter-community edges deviate from the 
two lines. For Figure 3(c), we flip more edge signs (p = 0.1, q = 0.2). We can observe that 
more nodes lie on the negative parts of the lines, since more inner-community edges are

changed to negative. The rotation angles of the two lines are smaller than that in  
Figure 3(b). This is because the positive inter-community edges ‘pull’ the rotation 
clockwise a little, and the rotation we observe depends on the effects from both positive 
and negative inter-community edges.

Calculation of the eigenvectors of an n × n matrix takes in general a number of operations 
O(n3), which is almost inapplicable for large networks. However, in our framework, we 
only need to calculate the first k eigen-pairs. Furthermore, adjacency matrices in our 
context are usually sparse. The Arnoldi/Lanczos algorithm (Golub and Van Loan, 1996) 
generally needs O(n) rather than O(n2) floating point operations at each iteration.

5 Evaluation 
5.1 Synthetic balanced graph 
Dataset Synth-3 is a synthetic three-balanced graph generated from the power law degree 
distribution with the scaling exponent 2.5. The three communities of Synth-3 contain  
600, 500, 400 nodes, and 4,131, 3,179, 2,037 edges respectively. All the 13,027  
inter-community edges are set to be negative. We delete the inter-community edges 
randomly until a proportion p of them remain in the graph. The parameter p is the ratio of 
the size of inter-community edges to that of the inner-community edges. If p = 0 there are 
no inter-community edges. If p = 1, inner- and inter-community edges have the same 
size. 
Figure 4 shows the change of spectral coordinates of Synth-3, as we increase the size 
of inter-community edges. When there are no negative links (p = 0), the scatter plot of the 
spectral coordinates is shown in Figure 4(a). The disconnected communities display three 
orthogonal half-lines. Figure 4(b) shows the spectral coordinates when the size of  
inter-community edges is moderate (p = 0.1). We can see the nodes form three half-lines 
that rotate a certain angle, and some of the nodes deviate from the lines. Figures 4(c)  
and 4(d) show the spectral coordinates when we increase the size of inter-community 
edges (p = 0.3, 1). We can observe that, as more inter-community edges are added, more 
and more nodes deviate from the lines. However, nodes from different communities are 
still separable from each other in the spectral space. 
We also add positive inter-community edges on Synth-3 for comparison, and the 
spectral coordinates are shown in Figures 4(e) and 4(f). We can observe that, different 
from adding negative edges, as the size of inter-community edges (p) increases,  
nodes from the three communities get closer to each other, and completely mix in one 
community in Figure 4(f). 
5.2 Synthetic unbalanced graph 
To generate an unbalanced graph, we randomly flip the signs of a small proportion q of 
the inner- and inter-community edges of a balanced graph, i.e., the parameter q is the 
proportion of unbalanced edges given the partition. We first flip edge signs of a small 
size of inter-community edges. Figures 5(a) and 5(b) show the spectral coordinates after 
we flip q = 10% and q = 20% edge signs on Synth-3 with p = 0.1. We can observe that, 
even the graph is unbalanced, nodes from the three communities exhibit three lines 
starting from the origin, and some nodes deviate from the lines due to the  
inter-community edges. 
We then flip edge signs of a large size of inter-community edges. Figure 5(c) shows 
the spectral coordinates after we flip q = 20% edge signs on Synth-3 with p = 1. We can 
observe that the line pattern diminishes because of the large number of inter-community 
edges. However, the nodes from three communities are separable in the spectral space, 
indicating that the unbalanced edges do not greatly change the patterns in the spectral 
space.

matrix perturbation theory (Stewart and Sun, 1990). Hence, when it comes to real-world

networks, the communities may no longer form distinguishable clusters in the Laplacian 
spectral space. 
Figure 6(a) shows the Laplacian spectrum of a balanced graph, Synth-3 with p = 0.1. 
We can see that the nodes from the three communities form three clusters in the spectral 
space. However, the Laplacian spectrum is less stable to the noise. Figures 6(b) and 6(c) 
plot the Laplacian spectra of the unbalanced graphs generated from Synth-3. We can 
observe that C1 and C2 are mixed together in Figure 6(b) and all the three communities 
are not separable from each other in Figure 6(c). For comparison, the adjacency spectra 
of the corresponding graphs were shown in Figure 5(b) and Figure 5(c) respectively 
where we can observe that the three communities are well-separable in the adjacency 
spectral space.

5.4 Case study on correlates of war 
We conduct an empirical evaluation on a real-world signed graph taken from the 
Correlates of War dataset over the period 1993–2001 (Ghosn et al., 2004). The dataset 
contains international relations such as alliance and dispute among different countries and 
areas. The dataset Formal Alliances (v3.03) records formal alliance among different 
countries. There are three types of alliance: defence pact (Type I), neutrality and  
non-aggression pact (Type II), and ententes (Type III). The dataset Militarised Interstates 
Disputes (v3.1) records all instances of when one state threatened, displayed, or used 
force against another, e.g., border extension between Colombia and Venezuela and 
Turkish groups entering Iraqi territory. There are five levels of dispute: no militarised 
action (Level 1), threat to use force (Level 2), display of force (Level 3), use of force 
(Level 4), and war (Level 5). For those disputes that involve different levels of actions, 
we use the highest level to represent the level of dispute. 
We construct a signed graph where military alliances are represented by positive 
edges and disputes by negative edges. We use the alliance of defence pact (Type I) to 
construct the cliques of positive edges and the disputes of use of force (Level 4) and war 
(Level 5) to construct the bipartite graph of negative edges. When the positive edge 
conflicts with the negative edge, we treat the negative edge with higher priority. This is 
because the use of force breaks the alliance. The adjacency matrix of the constructed 
signed graph A contains 159 nodes with 1,093 positive edges and 155 negative edges. 
USA has the maximum number of positive links and Yugoslavia has the maximum 
number of negative links. 
Figure 7 shows the distribution of eigenvalues. We can see that the first five 
eigenvalues are significantly greater than the remaining ones. We project the spectral 
coordinate of each point onto the unit sphere and apply the classic k-means algorithm 
(setting k = 5) to partition this signed network. To measure the partition quality, we 
define EDiff = p(i) + n(o) – p(o) – n(i), where p(i) and p(o) are the number of positive edges 
inside and outside each community whereas n(i) and n(o) are the number of negative edges 
inside and outside each community. Note that EDiff indicates the degree of balance of the 
signed graph. A higher EDiff value indicates a better community partition. Figure 8 
shows the different EDiff values when we vary the number of partitions (k). We can see 
EDiff reaches its maximum when k = 5.

We plot the world map based on our output with five communities in Figure 9. The 
power blocs can be identified as follows: Latin America, the West (including USA, 
Canada, Australia, and West European countries), Muslim World, West Africa, and 
China and the former Soviet Union. Our results match the configuration depicted in 
Huntington (1997) with a few notable exceptions. The West African power bloc is absent 
in the configuration of Huntington (1997). Some other noteworthy differences are  
South Korea is grouped with the West and South Africa is grouped with China and the 
Soviet Union.

6 Related work 
Social networks have received much attention these days. To understand and utilise the 
information in a social network, researches have developed various methods to capture 
the structure and characteristics of the network from different perspectives (Kleinberg, 
2007; Shiga et al., 2007; Tantipathananandh et al., 2007; Backstrom et al., 2006; Koren  
et al., 2006; Berger-Wolf and Saia, 2006; Kumar et al., 2006; Fast et al., 2005; Spertus  
et al., 2005; Baumes et al., 2004; Girvan and Newman, 2002; Kempe et al., 2003). 
Among them, spectral analysis of the adjacency matrix and its variants (e.g., Laplacian 
matrix and normal matrix) has shown intimate relationship between the combinatorial 
characteristics of a graph and the algebraic spectral properties of its matrix (Seary  
and Richards, 2003). For example, the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix encode 
information about the cycles of a network as well as its diameter. 
There is also a large literature on examining the eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian 
or normal matrix with various applications such as spectral clustering (Hagen and Kahng, 
1992; Chan et al., 1993; Pothen et al., 1990; Shi and Malik, 2000; Ng et al., 2001; Ding  
et al., 2001; Huang et al., 2008) and graph visualisation (Belkin and Niyogi, 2002). In 
spectral analysis of the Laplacian matrix or the normal matrix, the coordinates are 
arranged to make the sum of all the distances between two nodes the smallest. In their 
projection spaces, closely related nodes are pulled together to form clusters. Many 
spectral clustering methods, which exploit this cluster property, have been developed 
including ratio cut, normalised cut, and min-max cut [refer to a recent tutorial  
(Von Luxburg, 2007)]. 
There are several studies on community partition in social networks with negative (or 
negatively weighted) edges (Yang et al., 2007; Bansal and Chawla, 2002; Demaine  
and Immorlica, 2003; Traag and Bruggeman, 2009). Bansal and Chawla (2002) 
introduced correlation clustering motivated by document clustering and agnostic learning 
and showed that it is an NP-hard problem to make a partition to a complete signed graph. 
Demaine and Immorlica (2003) gave an approximation algorithm based on a  
linear-programming rounding and the region-growing technique and showed that the 
problem is APX-hard, i.e., any approximation would require improving the best 
approximation algorithms known for minimum multi-cut. Traag and Bruggeman (2009) 
adapted the concept of modularity to detect communities in networks where both positive 
and negative links are present and also evaluated the social network of international 
disputes and alliances. However, the algorithm involves several parameters that are hard 
to configure in practice. Yang et al. (2007) investigated community partition from social 
networks with negative edges. Kunegis et al. (2009) presented a case study on the signed 
Slashdot Zoo corpus and analysed various measures (including signed clustering 
coefficient and signed centrality measures). Leskovec (2010) studied several signed 
online social networks (Epinions, Slashdot, and the voting network of Wikipedia) and 
developed a theory of status to explain the observed edge signs. Spectral graph analysis 
can help users capture topological structures in spectral spaces. Laplacian graph kernels 
that apply to signed graphs were described in Hou (2005) and Kunegis et al. (2010). 
However, the authors only focused on two-balanced signed graphs and many results 
(such as signed graphs’ definiteness property) do not hold for general k-balanced graphs.

7 Conclusions 
We conducted theoretical studies based on graph perturbation to examine spectral 
patterns of signed graphs, which extends our preliminary research reported in Wu et al. 
(2011b). Our results showed that communities in a k-balanced signed graph are 
distinguishable in the spectral space of its signed adjacency matrix even when 
connections between communities are dense. To our best knowledge, these are the first 
reported findings on showing separability of communities in the spectral space of the 
signed adjacency matrix. We applied our partition method to a real-world signed network 
and our findings match explanations of international relations. In our future work, we will 
conduct evaluations on more signed networks and compare with other clustering methods 
for signed networks such as Traag and Bruggeman (2009).
